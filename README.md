Hardware:
- The kit I have used: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32957578028.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4c1b4c4dXdynT4
- Also some connectors (I had to bend some of the conductors with a knife but it worked: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32715715490.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4c1b4c4dXdynT4

And this is the code for the Arduino: https://gist.github.com/axodox/fac6c9a75c17ead82e49d90523599765

Requires Visual Studio 2019 and the C++/WinRT extension installed to build (these can be downloaded free from Microsoft).

My config file (to define the layout): https://gist.github.com/axodox/9f66640f25d3e891e7fcd43df5818a0d#file-luxconf-json
Can be imported by clicking the USB icon on the UI's bottom left corner, all other stuff on the UI should be self explanatory.
